I think it is safe to assume that the common goal for the majoity of computer science and engineering students is to land a job at a big tech firm. I always heard FAANG to be the pinnacle of tech and it was a dream of mine to work at a FAANG company. Over the past two years, this dream of mine slowly faded. I think there are a couple reasons why FAANG is no longer a goal of mine but ultimately, it came down to what I valued in a job.

### Outline What You Value in a Job
I think it's important for people to outline exactly what they desire in a job, whether that is high pay, flexibility, career growth, etc. I think putting all these factors into a decision matrix can help visualize what you want. My decision matrix looks something like this:

### Decision Matrix

Criteria Weighting (1-7), Scoring Scale (1-5)
- Early-Stage Startup: Pre-seeed to Series A stage startups
- Mid-Stage Startup: Series B onward startups with 100-500 employees
- Unicorn: Valued at 1B+, rapid growth
- Pre-IPO Firm: Large private company preparing for public offering
- Mid-Sized Tech Firm: Stable tech firms with 1000+ employees
- Big-Tech Firm: Large corporations with strong brand recognition


| Criteria (Weight) | Early-Stage Startup | Mid-Stage Startup  | Unicorn | Pre-IPO Firm | Mid-Sized Tech Firm | Big-Tech Firm
|-----------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| Compensation & Benefits (6) | 2 (12)   | 3 (18)   | 4 (24)   | 5 (30)   | 4 (24)   | 5 (30)  |
| Flexibility (2)             | 1 (2)    | 1 (2)    | 3 (3)    | 3 (3)    | 3 (3)    | 3 (3)   |
| Equity (4)                  | 5 (20)   | 4 (16)   | 3 (12)   | 4 (16)   | 1 (4)    | 3 (12)  |
| Impact (5)                  | 5 (25)   | 4 (20)   | 3 (15)   | 2 (10)   | 1 (5)    | 1 (5)   |
| Career Growth (7)           | 3 (21)   | 5 (35)   | 4 (28)   | 4 (28)   | 3 (21)   | 4 (28)  |
| Job Stability (3)           | 1 (3)    | 2 (6)    | 3 (9)    | 4 (12)   | 3 (9)    | 3 (9)   |
| Company Mission (1)         | --       | --       | --       | --       | --       | --      |
| **Total Score**             | **83**   | **97**   | **91**   | **99**   | **66**   | **87**  |

### Explaining My Thought Process
My decision matrix is by no means an end-all-be-all solution as the score for a lot of these criteria will change based on the company. Firstly, company mission obviously depends on the company and not what stage it is in so I left that criteria unrated. I also think big tech can be very hit or miss. If you land on a high-impact team, you’ve essentially hit the jackpot—enjoying top-tier compensation, significant influence, and outstanding career growth. However, the reality for most engineers is that they end up on low-impact teams where projects take months to complete, making it harder to see meaningful progress. 

For me, what I truly value is being surrounded by the smartest engineers in the world, learning from them, and moving at a fast pace alongside them. I think that is the formula to personal and career growth so a startup is the only viable option to be in an environment like that. Based on my decision matrix, pre-IPO firms and mid-stage startups would suite me the most and I agree with that assessment. While a pre-IPO firm might not offer the same career growth, the potential payout from stock options when the company goes public is a major upside that is ultimatley the goal of startups anyway. After all this analysis, my final conclusion is I would still take any job I get because I am jobless at the moment.
